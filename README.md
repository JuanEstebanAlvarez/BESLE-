# BESLE++-
This repository contains the extension of the open-source software BEM package BESLE,which is now being implemented in C++

BESLE is a Boundary Element Software for 3D Linear Elasticity developed by Andres F. Galvis, at the Department of Computational Mechanics, School of Computational Engineering, The University of Campinas in 09/10/2020.

The first version of BESLE has been implemented in Fortran90, which is MPI-parallelized, found at https://github.com/Afgr1087/BESLE_v1.0.
This BESLE extension is fully parallelized on an object-oriented C++ architecture, re-designed into kernel features (easily accessible), and to be used for Windows, Linux and Mac OS users. Besides, new features can be included by working as developer mode.
